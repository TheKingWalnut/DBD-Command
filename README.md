# DBD-Command

Each command starts with !streak, but the next word depends on what you want to do. I am working on making it update stuff in a picture right now, but that'll take a while.
# MOD ONLY COMMANDS
!streak add {killer name} - Adds 1 to that killers streak and adds 1 to the current streak. If the current streak is better than the max streak, update the max streak.
  
!streak set {killer name} {value} - Sets the given killer's streak to the given value
  
!streak reset {killer name} - Sets the passed in killer's streak to zero.

# COMMANDS ANYONE CAN USE
!streak view - Returns the current streak and the best streak. *HAS NO INFO ON KILLER ATM*
