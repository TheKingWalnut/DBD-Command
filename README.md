# DBD-Command

Each command starts with !streak, but the next word depends on what you want to do. I am working on making it update stuff in a picture right now, but that'll take a while.
# MOD ONLY COMMANDS
!streak add {killer name} - Adds 1 to the passed in killer's streak. If that streak is now larger than the max streak, change max streak to that killer's streak.
  
!streak set {killer name} {value} - Sets the given killer's streak to the given value
  
!streak reset {killer name} - Sets the passed in killer's streak to zero.

# COMMANDS ANYONE CAN USE
!streak view {OPTIONAL: KILLER NAME}: Returns the max streak and who Adam was playing when he got that max streak. If a killer name is passed in, returns that killer's streak as well as the max streak.
